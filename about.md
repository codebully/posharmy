Posh Army (2006-2009) were a band in Cleveland.

Performing everywhere between New York City, Chicago including rumoured secret gigs at the **Teatro alla Scala**, the quartet went on to release three demo tapes and one full length during a ground shaking nightclub gig that united generations. Tragedy struck days after the release as frontman Max Fowler mysteriously disappeared in the Rocky Mountains.

The remaining members went on to form [Sixes and Sevens](http://notbob.bandcamp.com/album/meow-ep) and [Nicky English](https://vimeo.com/20271440) with various Cleveland musicians.

Six and a half years after playing their last show all together, they reunited for one night only at their legendary stomping grounds, The Grog Shop in Cleveland.
