Posh Army (2006-2009) were a band in Cleveland.

Performing everywhere between New York City, Chicago including rumoured secret gigs at the **Teatro alla Scala**, the quartet went on to release three demo tapes and [one full length](http://notbob.bandcamp.com/album/top-four-finish) during a ground shaking nightclub gig that united generations. Tragedy struck days after the release as frontman Max Fowler mysteriously disappeared in the Rocky Mountains.

The remaining members went on to form [Sixes and Sevens](http://notbob.bandcamp.com/album/meow-ep) and [Nicky English](https://vimeo.com/20271440) with various Cleveland musicians.

Now, six and a half years after playing their last show all together, they are back, for one night only, at the club where it all began. Famed documentary maker Velentina Tokarev has agreed to film the show as part a cultural program on rock and roll messiahs.

Posh Army are:

+ Nikita - guitar, vocals.
+ Maxxy - vocals.
+ Nate - guitar, vocals.
+ Ham Trentway - good times, drums.
+ Nils - bass.
+ Robby - bass, vocals.

It's gonna be cool shit.
